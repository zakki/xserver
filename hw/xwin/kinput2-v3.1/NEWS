Major changes from version 3.0 to 3.1:

* Kinput2 now supports ATOK.  The source code is kindly contributed
  by Justsystem Corporation.  Thanks!
  To compile for Atok, define symbol `UseAtok' in Kinput2.conf.

* Minimum support of Wnn7 is implemented.

* Two IC attributes, XNPreeditState and XNResetState both of which
  are introduced by X11R6, are supported.

* Kinput2's `egg'-emulation is improved.

* A workaround for bugs in some Xlib implementations has been added.

* Previously, when kinput2 cannot connect to jserver, kinput2 seems
  to be frozen (actually it keeps retrying).  Now kinput2 beeps and
  ends conversion in such a case.  The next time you start conversion,
  it tries to connect again.


Major changes from version 2.0 fix4 (the last official release) to
version 3.0:

* Kinput2 now supports Wnn6.  The source code is kindly contributed by
  MORIBE, Hideyuki.  Thanks!  To compile for Wnn6, define symbol
  `UseWnn6' in Kinput2.conf.

  For those who use both Wnn4 and Wnn6, distinct wnn initialization
  files (wnnenvrc) for Wnn4 jserver and Wnn6 jserver can be specified.
  Kinput2 checks the server version at run time, and selects an
  appropriate one.  Use `*.wnnEnvrc4' resource for specifying
  initialization file for Wnn4, `*.wnnEnvrc6' for Wnn6.

  Due to Wnn6 support, Wnn4 implementation part saw major changes.
  We've tried to keep user visible changes small, though.

* On-the-spot input style is available for Ximp and XIM protocols.
  The code is contributed by Kazuki YASUMATSU.  Thank you!
  For XIM protocol, following styles are now supported:
  	XIMPreeditPosition | XIMStatusArea (over-the-spot style)
  	XIMPreeditPosition | XIMStatusNothing (over-the-spot style)
  	XIMPreeditArea | XIMStatusArea (off-the-spot style)
	XIMPreeditCallbacks | XIMStatusCallbacks (on-the-spot style)
	XIMPreeditCallbacks | XIMStatusNothing (on-the-spot style)
	XIMPreeditNothing | XIMStatusNothing (root-window style)

* Kinput2 now supports an IC attribute called FilterEvents.  Some
  applications seem to require the input server to support this
  attribute, or they go crazy if not.

* Finally, word registration facility is available for Wnn.  A new
  fuction called `register' is added, and bound to F5 and ^T by
  default. (If you're using ccdef.kinput2.egg, that's F4) This
  function is supposed to invoke word registration utility called
  `tkwnnreg'.  You need a separate package for the utility, currently
  available from:
	ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/lang/tcl/contrib/tcl-wnn-X.Y.tar.gz
  X.Y is 0.3 as of this writing.  It is still alpha-quality, but I'll
  work on it once I finish release work of kinput2.

* Kinput2's `egg'-emulation has been improved.

* You can specify preedit font and status font independently when XIM
  protocol is used.  Previously preedit font was used for both preedit
  area and status area.

* Now kinput2's mode shell (the small status window appeared when
  over-the-spot input is active) has Mwm hints that says "I need no
  titlebar".

* A new boolean resource `useOverrideShellForMode' is provided to use
  overrideShell for the mode displaying widget, instead of the default
  transientShell.  This is needed for some window managers which
  ignores kinput2's input focus preference, causing flickering of mode
  display.
